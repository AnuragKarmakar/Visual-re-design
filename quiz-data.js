      "Ad naturam - tactic in which it is proposed that \"a thing is good because it is 'natural', or bad because it is unnatural.\" e.g. Just because it's natural in one time and place, doesn't mean it's true in all contexts.",
      "Cum hoc ergo propter hoc - informal fallacy that states: \"Since event Y followed event X, event Y must have been caused by event X.\" e.g. I can not assume that because I farted after I ate the beans that the beans caused the fart",
      "Dicto simpliciter - Occurs when the arguer fails to recognise the difference between rules of thumb and categorical propositions, rules that hold true universally. e.g. I cannot kill the exception to the rule - every time and place relation sits in a unique context and is never universal.",
      "Ab anecdote - Where anecdotal evidence is presented as an argument; without any other contributory evidence or reasoning. e.g. personal stories are not proof, and can metastasise across an information landscape and tear it up like a multitude of feral pigs.",
      "Tu quoque - is a discussion technique that intends to discredit the opponent's argument by attacking the opponent's own personal behaviour and actions as being inconsistent with their argument, therefore accusing hypocrisy. e.g. I am not a bully in the playground so \"I know you are but what am I?\" is not a valid argument.",
      "Ad temperantiam - considering two statements about the colour of the sky on Earth during the day - one claiming, correctly, that the sky is blue, and another claiming that it is yellow - and incorrectly concluding that the sky is the intermediate colour, green. e.g. I can not assume that being on the fence between two enemies is the right place to be",
      "Ad fastidium (or \"appeal to disgust\" or \"argument from disgust\" or \"wisdom of repugnance\" or \"yuck factor\") is a logical fallacy that occurs when it is argued that something is morally wrong because it is gross (or conversely, it is good because it is beautiful). e.g. I must not hijack peoples feelings by making them feel disgust just to win an argument",
      "Onus probandi is the obligation to provide sufficient supporting evidence for claims that you make. For example, if someone claims that ghosts exist, then the burden of proof means that they need to provide evidence that supports this. e.g. I cannot push forward false claims by demanding that others prove that they are right or wrong",
      "Ad ignorantiam also known as appeal to ignorance (in which ignorance represents \"a lack of contrary evidence\"), is a fallacy in informal logic. It asserts that a proposition is true because it has not yet been proven false or a proposition is false because it has not yet been proven true. e.g. I cannot claim that something is true just because it has not been proven false",
